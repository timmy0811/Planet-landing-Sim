# Planet-landing-Sim
This project is all about landing secure on a strange planet without getting damaged. It is in use of the pygame module to display the graphical surface. To this moment, there is only the fall sequence implemented... but it got all it needs; sounds, animations and more

### The Controlls
  * use ``Space`` to use the main thrust, it can be used to accelerate the craft up or down
  * use ``Arrow-Keys`` to use the side-thruster and steer the craft around it's own axis
